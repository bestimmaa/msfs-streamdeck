# msfs-streamdeck
A standalone application to turn the Elgato Stream Deck into a Flight Simulator interface.

This python app is basically an extended version of python-elgato-streamdeck sample. It includes a variety of buttons that interact with and display information from the auto pilot using SimConnect. It also includes icons to be used as buttons that support the On / Off state. They are generated from the excellent template provided by https://fsresources.weebly.com/stream-deck-templates.html
